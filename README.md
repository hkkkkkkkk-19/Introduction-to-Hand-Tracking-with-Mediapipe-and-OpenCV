# Intro-to-Hand-Tracking-with-OpenCV
Dive into the world of hand tracking with MediaPipe! This code was my personal journey to grasp the basics—processing frames and tracking those initial points. It’s all about building a solid foundation in computer vision and having fun along the way!

# Basic Hand Tracking with MediaPipe
Welcome to my personal exploration of hand tracking! This code demonstrates the fundamentals of using MediaPipe to understand hand tracking basics, focusing on camera initialization, frame processing, and the importance of reversing frames for proper display.
## Overview
Objective: Build a clear understanding of hand tracking.
Tools Used: MediaPipe for hand detection.
Approach: Simple implementation to understand the structure of landmarks and camera setup.
##Requirements
-Python 3.11
-MediaPipe library
-OpenCV library
How to Run
1.Clone this repository.
2.Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Key Features
-Camera Initialization: Sets up the camera and captures frames.
-Frame Reversal: Frames are reversed for a correct mirror effect.
-Exit Mechanism: Press the Q key to exit the camera view.
